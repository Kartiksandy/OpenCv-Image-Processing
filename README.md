## Image Processing Techniques with OpenCV: Harris Corner Detection and Beyond

This project explores various image processing techniques using OpenCV, including Harris Corner Detection, Image Pyramids, Watershed Segmentation, SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) Keypoint Detection, and YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection. The notebook demonstrates the implementation of these techniques and provides visualizations to highlight their effects on sample images.

### Project Highlights:

1. **Harris Corner Detection:**
   - **Objective:** Detect corners in an image using the Harris Corner Detection algorithm.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Convert the image to grayscale.
     2. Apply Harris Corner Detection to identify corners.
     3. Highlight detected corners in red on the original image and display it.

2. **Image Pyramid Construction:**
   - **Objective:** Create an image pyramid, which is a multi-scale representation of the original image.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Generate an image pyramid by repeatedly applying `cv2.pyrDown`.
     2. Display each layer of the pyramid in a grid format using `matplotlib`.

3. **Watershed Segmentation:**
   - **Objective:** Segment an image into distinct regions using the Watershed algorithm.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Preprocess the image with grayscale conversion, binary thresholding, morphological operations, and distance transform.
     2. Apply the Watershed algorithm to segment the image and highlight the boundaries in the original image.

4. **SIFT Keypoint Detection:**
   - **Objective:** Detect and visualize keypoints in an image using the SIFT algorithm.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Convert the image to grayscale.
     2. Detect SIFT keypoints.
     3. Draw and display the keypoints on the original image.

5. **YOLO Object Detection:**
   - **Objective:** Perform object detection on an image using the YOLO algorithm.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Initialize YOLO by loading pre-trained weights, configuration, and class names.
     2. Preprocess the image into a blob for YOLO input.
     3. Perform a forward pass through the YOLO network to obtain detections.
     4. Apply Non-Maximum Suppression to filter out weak detections.
     5. Draw bounding boxes with labels on the image and display it.
